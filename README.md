# kali linux commands

- prints current working directry, uses to redirect to open a file - `pwd`  
- list all files - `ls`
- list of all files in the directory with details - `ls -la`
- open a folder - `cd`
- previous folder - `..`  
- prints descrption of a function - `man`   
-  Delete a file `rm -rf` 
- used to update like (winget in windows) - `sudo apt-get update` 
- upgrade kali linux - `sudo apt upgrade` 
- update kali linux - `sudo apt update`
- run 2 commands concurently -  `ls;pwd`
- run the 2nd command directly by neglecting the first commands - `ls | pwd `

## check IP address


- to check the information of the target website  
```
http://whois.domaintools.com/
```
- to check which techonology is used in target website  
```
http://toolbar.netcraft.com/site_report?url=
```

- which which website have same ipaddress  

>if we can hack into 1 we can hack all the other

```
https://www.robtex.com/ 
```  
- Using bing.com, search for `ip: [target ip]`

## FileUploadVulnerability
- weevely is a tool used for opening the backdoors and to access the website.
```
weevely generate 123456 /root/shell.php
```
- this creates a php file which is used to upload and open backdoors
- after uploading, run the following command
- `weevely (respective url) 123456`
- now from the terminal we can open the backdoor that is  `cd ..` to get back and then we can access as we want.
- burpsuite is used to interpt the website being executed with the help of proxy.

> __low__ - any file can be uploaded i.e., shell.php

> 
> __medium__ - we rename the file from shell.php to shell.jepg i.e., shell.jpeg and upload it using bruiteforce by changing the filename to php.

> 
> __high__ - we change the file type to shell.php.jpeg and upload and then expoit.

- overall output will be..

## Code Execution Vulnerability

- open any searchable website (dvwa- command execution)
- run the following command
```
nc -vv -l -p 8080
```

> nc   = netcat tool this is used to use and connect the computer to the website.
> 
> -vv  = it is just a verbose mode, which retireve more output.
> 
> -l   = Listen mode, used to create a server that listens for incoming connections.
> 
> -p   = Specifies the source port number.
> 
> 8080 = port number.
- Now you can execute any command of kali linux such as pwd, ls -la.
- the execution will be done.

> __low__ - in searchbox END WITH ";" AND RUN THE COMMAND ACCORDING TO THE WEBSITE OS.MOST IMPORTANT IF THE IP IS 192.168.11.129, SUBTRACT THE LAST NUMBER -1 THAT IS 192.168.11.128.
>
> __medium__ - it cannot run two commands using ";" so we use "|" for the exploit.

>
> __high__ is not even possible


## File Inclusion Vulnerability
- it allows you to read  any file in the same server.
- access files outside www directory.
- generally to get the commands to be executed in the kali linux we use  `cat etc/passwd`, the same we use in the file url to extract all the saved passwds.
```
http://192.168.11.129/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=/../../../../../etc/passwd
```
- by using this command we can get the all saved passwords saved in the webserver.

- Now as reference from the above use the another executable urls.

- from above image the first one  `proc/self/environ` we get..
